## 📌 What Is AWS Networking?
AWS Networking lets you create isolated, secure, and scalable network environments in the cloud—just like a data center, but virtual and infinitely flexible.

## 🔑 Core Services & Concepts

### 🏗️ **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
- Your **private network** in AWS
- Divide into **public subnets** (internet-facing) and **private subnets** (internal-only)
- Control routing with **Route Tables**

### 🛡️ **Security Layers**
- **Security Groups**: Stateful firewalls for EC2 instances (allow rules only)
- **Network ACLs**: Stateless subnet-level firewalls (allow/deny rules)

### 🌍 **Connectivity & DNS**
- **Internet Gateway**: Connect VPC to the public internet
- **Route 53**: Scalable, reliable **DNS service** for domain routing and health checks
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private access to AWS services (e.g., S3) without internet

## 💼 Why It Matters for My Career
Cloud networking is essential for:
- **Cloud Network Engineers**
- **Security Specialists**
- **DevOps & SRE Roles**

It proves I understand **zero-trust architecture**, **isolation**, and **secure communication**.

## 🧪 Hands-On Practice
- Built a 3-tier VPC (public, private app, private DB subnets)
- Configured Security Groups to allow only HTTP/HTTPS from the internet
- Set up Route 53 to route traffic to a static S3 website
