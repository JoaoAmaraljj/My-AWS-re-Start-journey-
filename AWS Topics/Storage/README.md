## 🔑 Core Services & Concepts

### 📁 **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
- **Object storage** for files, backups, logs, and static websites
- **99.999999999% (11 nines) durability**
- Storage classes: `S3 Standard`, `Intelligent-Tiering`, `Glacier` (for archives)
- Secured via **Bucket Policies**, **ACLs**, and **IAM**

### 💿 **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**
- **Block storage** volumes attached to EC2 instances (like a virtual hard drive)
- Ideal for databases, boot volumes, and persistent apps

### 📂 **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**
- **Shared file storage** accessible by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously
- Great for content management, dev environments, and big data

## 💼 Why It Matters for My Career
Storage design impacts **cost**, **performance**, and **compliance**—key for:
- **Cloud Architects**
- **Data Analysts**
- **Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)**

This shows I can implement **cost-optimized**, **secure**, and **durable** data strategies.

## 🧪 Hands-On Practice
- Hosted a static portfolio website on **S3** with custom domain (via Route 53)
- Configured lifecycle policies to move old logs to **S3 Glacier**
- Attached an **EBS volume** to an EC2 instance and verified persistence after reboot
