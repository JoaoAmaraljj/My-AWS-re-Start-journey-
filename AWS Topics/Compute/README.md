### _Renting Virtual Computers in the Cloud_

> “Instead of buying servers, I rent scalable, on-demand compute power—and only pay while it’s running.”

## 📌 What Is AWS Compute?
AWS Compute services let you run applications in the cloud without managing physical hardware. Whether you need full control over virtual machines or just want to run code without servers, AWS has you covered.

## 🔑 Core Services & Concepts

### 🖥️ **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
- On-demand virtual servers (Linux/Windows)
- Customizable CPU, RAM, storage, and networking
- Secured via **Security Groups** and **IAM Roles**
- Used for web apps, batch processing, and more

### ⚡ **AWS Lambda**
- **Serverless** compute: run code in response to events (e.g., file upload, API call)
- No server management, automatic scaling
- Pay per millisecond of execution

### 📈 **Auto Scaling & Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**
- Automatically add/remove EC2 instances based on traffic
- Distribute incoming traffic across healthy instances for **high availability**
