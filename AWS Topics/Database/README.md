## 📌 What Are AWS Databases?
AWS offers **fully managed database services** for structured (SQL) and unstructured (NoSQL) data—so you can build faster without worrying about maintenance, patching, or replication.

## 🔑 Core Services & Concepts

### 📊 **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**
- Managed SQL databases: **MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQL Server**
- Automated backups, patching, and failure detection
- **Multi-AZ deployments** for disaster recovery
- **Read Replicas** for read-heavy workloads

### 🚀 **Amazon DynamoDB**
- Fully managed **NoSQL** database
- Single-digit millisecond performance at any scale
- Built-in security, backup, and in-memory caching
- Ideal for mobile, gaming, and IoT apps

### 🔒 **Security & Compliance**
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- IAM authentication and fine-grained access control
- Audit-ready with AWS CloudTrail
