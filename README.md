## 🚀 About My AWS re/Start Journey
I have completed my **[AWS re/Start](https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/)** program at [Praesignis](https://praesignis.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqD0hc8eBI2eIoixvHt0ilWayKmAPYa14N6N9yGQPiWQxHQoLIg), intensive 12-week training that equipped me with hands-on experience in the following topics:
**cloud architecture, security, automation, Python Scripting for Automation and core AWS services**.   

This portfolio documents my learning path, labs, and reflections as I prepare for the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam and my first role in cloud technology.
