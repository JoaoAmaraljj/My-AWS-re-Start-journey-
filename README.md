# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name]!  
### 🌩️ Aspiring Cloud Practitioner | AWS re/Start Graduate  

> “I’m building a career in cloud computing—one service, one lab, and one line of code at a time.”

## 🚀 About My AWS re/Start Journey
I recently completed the **[AWS re/Start](https://aws.amazon.com/restart/)** program—a free, intensive 12-week training that equipped me with hands-on experience in **cloud architecture, security, automation, and core AWS services**.  

This portfolio documents my learning path, labs, and reflections as I prepare for the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam and my first role in cloud technology.
